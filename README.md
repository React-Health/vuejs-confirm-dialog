# vuejs-confirm-dialog

Simple library for creating reusable dialogs in Vue 3. Made with Composition API.

Inspired by [`Vueuse`](https://github.com/vueuse/vueuse) and [`vue-modal-dialog`](https://github.com/hjkcai/vue-modal-dialogs). Thank you ❤️!

> ⚠️  Warning! Work in progress. Don't use it in production!

Powered by vue-demi, so you can use it in Vue 2, but this required `@vue/composition-api` >= v1.1
This is a library for creating reusable dialogs. It promisifies your component, so you can work with it like with promises or work with dialog hooks that the library generates for you.
